                                Rails Girls started in Helsinki in 2010 with very humble beginnings. It’s now a community thriving in 160 cities around the world. Ruby and its community has influenced Rails Girls from the start and every step of the way. During our talk we’ll go through a history of Rails Girls, tell various anecdotes, and explore:<br/>

It's my personal goal to introduce as many people as possible to open-source and make it dead simple for them to contribute.

What happens if you have something specific you want to contribute?

This talk will show you the best practices for discussing features and ideas with ruby-core. We'll show you how to get your high-level concepts imagined through effecient channels of discussion to implementation.

We should talk about how fear and language barriers play a role in getting the right kind of feedback. We'll also talk about how ruby-core operates with the vast distance between its members.

Most importantly, we'll give you the confidence to work effectively with ruby-core and how we can improve Ruby together.</li>

It also tries to point out the benefits that every Rubyist gets from the Ruby ecosystem, while gently letting them know that those things don't happen for free. Hopefully, by providing that information, we can ask people to contribute time and effort to improving things for everyone and sound like we are leading by example, rather than demanding that someone step up to solve the problems for us, already.

                                <li>summary: In the 1980's, Nintendo had plans for making a knitting add-on to the NES, with an interface that resembled Mariopaint, but with patterned mittens, sweaters, and scarves as output.  Sadly, this product never saw the light of day.  Devastated upon hearing this and dreaming about what could have been, a group of Airbnb engineers (who knew nothing about machine knitting) set out to hack a knitting machine from the 1980's to be computer-controlled, using a tutorial from adafruit as a starting point.

Hear about our struggles and triumphs, which ranged from learning to replace knitting machine needles and conduct basic repairs, to emulating a floppy drive and hacking together a custom cable cable to send our own patterns to the machine, to writing our own yarn printer API in ruby/rails and printing our first doge meme in yarn.  And watch us (LIVE!) as we send images and knit requests to our yarn server, and behold as it knits ugly sweaters from those images!</li>

                                <li>summary: We are all born with a sense of wonder and amazement at the world around us. Many of us just learn to turn it off as we grow older and jaded. I believe this is partly because we don’t understand what goes on in the world around us well enough, and thus we don’t care either. This talk is an attempt to bring back that wonder and sense of discovery of the world around us through the tools of our trade -- programming and analyzing data.

It’s hard to explore the whole wide world with just bits and bytes. So if we can’t explore the world we live in, we’ll create our own worlds and explore those — in other words, we’ll use simulations. Simulations are an excellent way of exploring things that we cannot control by simply focusing on those things we can. This enables us to simplify and eventually understand the real world better.

In this talk, I'll discuss how Ruby can be used to build a simulated world, bring that to life and explore various facets of that simulated world. I will show how Ruby is not just for developing web applications, it's also an exciting tool for exploration.</li>

After nearly a decade as a Java developer for companies like Kodak, CNN, and GE, he decided to end his addiction to heavy inheritance, static typing, and coding without tests. These days, he practices clean Ruby living with lots of well-tested code, class composition, and fun dynamic languages as a developer/startup CTO for hire with extensive experience in data science and committer on open source projects such as the Passbook-iOS, Asari and Active Asari Gems. He is known to practice interspecies pair (purr) programming with his orange tabby, Allie, and when he's not writing code, you will find him diving with sharks, trekking through Chernobyl, sampling wine, cheering on the Springboks or perfecting his biltong recipe.</li>

Every time a user clicks a button, buys something, or our application does any number of things we have the opportunity to gain useful insights. But where do you begin? Should I gather every data point I can think of? What tools work the best? There is a lot of talk and hype about analytics. In this session, let's take a look at what goes into mining data and analyzing the insights. We'll discuss different approaches to gathering, storing, and querying data, how to determine the KPIs to focus on, and how to interpret and use information in meaningful ways. While you may not be a statistician, see how some basic statistics can help you to start to wrangle your data.</li>

After 1 year, We finished upgrading Ruby 1.8.7 to 2.1.0 and Rails 2.3 to 3.2. We got a lot of idea and practice from this success. In this talk, I will introduce following themes from the point of view of deeply technical side.

 * How do we reduce technical debt?
 * How do we upgrade Rails while adding new features?
 * How do we do continuous delivery and  migrating the database simultaneously?

I'll talk about migration methodologies of ordinary web companies in Japan. If you are interested in continuous maintenance and continuous delivery, I definitely recommend this talk.</li>

                                <li>summary: All of us want to be happy. We want to find meaningful work that fills us with a sense of purpose. That might not be difficult, and there are a lot of self-help books out there that teaches you how to be happy. However, we are not isolated - we work in teams, 8 hours a day or even longer. So, it's not enough to be happy alone. We need our teams to be happy too, because that directly affects us.

We all know that happy people are the most productive people (try Googling it), but what about having a happy team?
How can you make a team happy?

In this talk, I'll go through the wonders of having a happy team and the ways you can make it happen. There will be real life case studies and practices that you can apply to your company to optimize it for happiness.

Things that I will cover are:
- Proper Planning
- Feedback / Retrospectives
- Daily Standups
- Show and Tell
- Pair Programming / Code Review
- Test Driven Development
- Continuous Integration / Deployment
- Learning Environment</li>

                                <li>summary: How to exploit full potential of parallel processing power from modern hardware has become more and more important as multi-core processors continue to thrive. Yet modern scripting language implementations usually use Global Interpreter Lock to avoid data synchronization issues which also restrict themselves from fully utilizing multiple cores. Though most alternative implementations do eliminate GIL via fine-grained locking, traditional locking mechanism demands careful design; otherwise it could lead to poor performance or even unpredictable results. Furthermore, this approach still requires developers to apply locking on their programs, which is often error-prone.


In this talk, I will introduce Software Transactional Memory which tries to simplify data synchronization by borrowing the concept of transactions from database systems. In addition, I will also introduce a brand new Ruby implementation using STM to ease the burden of parallel programming in Ruby.</li>

Functional programming is a style of programming that can be done in any language that has some basic features, like lambdas. So there is nothing stopping us from bringing some FP into our Ruby. There is already a lot of influence from functional programming in Ruby, more then you might think.

In the process we'll gain thread-safety, prevent bugs due to mutable state, and become better, more versatile programmers.</li>

                                <li>bio: Lin Jen Shin (godfat) is a programmer who loves computer games, open source, Haskell and self-referential jokes, such as: %p=~/(.+)/;puts(($1%%$1)[/: (.+)/,1])"=~/(.+)/;puts(($1%$1)[/: (.+)/,1])</li>

                                <li>subject: RubyQC -- A conceptual QuickCheck library for Ruby</li>

                                <li>summary: How do we make sure our programs work as expected?
Taking it to the extreme, of course we prove it formally.
We have Agda for Haskell people, or Coq for OCaml people.

However, in most cases we don't really care if they are
100% correct. Do we care PRNGs are really random
in games? Some people might care, we don't. Can we
prove halting problem? Of course not, but we do need
termination check at times.

For most cases, an army of tests is far good enough.
Usually we write scenario based tests. We first assume
things, and then do things, finally verify results. This is
quite simple, but cannot really cover most of the inputs
without great effort.

QuickCheck took another approach. Instead of writing
scenario, we think about what properties do our programs,
or functions have, giving a range of inputs. Suppose
we want to test the reverse function, instead of testing
against a fixed set of lists and verify a fixed set of results,
we think about what properties does reverse have.

For example, if we reverse and reverse a list, the result
should be equal to the original list. With QuickCheck, it
could then generate arbitrary random lists to the property
function you just wrote, and verify if the property holds.
By default, it would generate 100 test cases.

This approach would force you think more about the
precondition and postcondition, eliminating unusual
corner cases you might never think of, and force you
think what are the functions we're really writing. We
could also raise the number of test cases by configuring
it and raise our level of confidence about correctness.</li>
